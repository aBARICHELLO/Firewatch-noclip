# Firewatch-noclip
Noclip mod for the game Firewatch

---

# How to Install
Download the DLL from the [releases tab](https://github.com/aBARICHELLO/Firewatch-noclip/releases) and place it in the game instalation folder<br>
(usually `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Firewatch\firewatch_Data\Managed`).<br>
To remove the mod simply delete the replaced DLL and ask Steam to verify the game's integrity, downloading back the original file.

# Usage
Unity3D uses a [Left-Handed coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system#Orientation_and_handedness), here are the buttons to change your position in-game.

|Key|Action|
|-|-|
|NumLock|Enable/Disable noclip
|PageUp/PageDown|Increase/Decrease your X position(right/left)
|Home/End|Increase/Decrease your Y Position(up/down)
|Insert/Delete|Increase/Decrease your Z Position(forward/back)
